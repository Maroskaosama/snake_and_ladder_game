How to use our system?
• 1. After selecting a piece of equipment, each player positions it on the initial square.
• 2. Roll a die to see who goes first. Go-first is the player with the highest rolling number.
• 3. The player advances their piece to the spaces indicated by rolling the dice during their turn.
• 4. If a player touches down on a square that has a ladder at its base, their piece ascends to the top of the ladder.
• 5. A player's piece descends to the snake's base if they land on a square with a snake at its head.
• 6. When a piece of a different player lands on a square that another player has already taken up, that player's piece is knocked back to the beginning square.
• 7. The winner of the game is the first person to reach the 100th tile.
• 8. A player's piece stays in its current location if they roll a number that would move it past the 100th square.
• 9. The piece that was moved last stays on the square if a player lands on a spot already occupied by that player's other piece.
